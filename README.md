Description:
This Python program serves as a simple calculator capable of performing basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It begins by listing the available operations (+, -, *, /). The program defines four functions, each corresponding to an arithmetic operation. The add(a, b) function returns the sum of a and b, sub(a, b) returns their difference, mul(a, b) returns their product, and div(a, b) returns their quotient, with a check to prevent division by zero by returning a "Zero Division Error" if b is zero. The user is prompted to enter two numerical values, which are converted to floating-point numbers to handle decimal calculations. The user is then asked to select an operation. The program verifies if the selected operation is valid and, based on the user's choice, calls the appropriate function with the input values as arguments, printing the result. If the user enters an invalid operation, the program prints "Invalid Operation." This program effectively demonstrates the basic principles of user input, function definition, and conditional statements in Python. It showcases how to handle arithmetic operations and potential errors like division by zero. By organizing the logic for each operation into separate functions, the program maintains clarity and modularity, making it easy to understand and extend. This simple yet practical example provides a clear foundation for more complex programming tasks involving arithmetic operations and user interaction.
Conclusion:
This simple calculator program effectively illustrates the core concepts of Python programming, including user input, function definition, and conditional logic. By breaking down each arithmetic operation into distinct functions, the code remains organized and easy to understand. The program also demonstrates basic error handling by addressing division by zero. Through this exercise, users can grasp the fundamentals of creating interactive applications that perform essential computational tasks. This foundational knowledge can be expanded to develop more sophisticated programs, emphasizing the importance of clear structure and modularity in coding. Overall, the program serves as a practical example for beginners to learn and apply basic programming skills in Python.
